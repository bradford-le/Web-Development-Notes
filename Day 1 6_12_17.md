##JavaScript

###Variables
1. const constName
2. let letName

**\*TIP\* declare variables in multiple lines, easier to read than one single lines**

3. Mozilla's JavaScript is the most thorough
4. ALWAYS use triple equal ===
  * Example: 2 == 2 will return true
  * '2' == 2 will also return true even though one is a string
  * '2' === 2 will return false
5. ALWAYS use !== for not equals
6. Understand falsy and truthy
  * undefined === falsy
  * a number not zero is truthy

**\*TIP\* better to use += than ++**
